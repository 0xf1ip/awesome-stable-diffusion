## Official Resources

* **[CompVis/Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)** - The official release of Stable Diffusion including a CLI, an AI-based Safety Classifier, which detects and suppresses sexualized content, and all the necessary files to get running.
* [stability-AI/stability-sdk](https://github.com/stability-AI/stability-sdk) - The official SDK used to build python applications integrated with StabilityAI's cloud platform instead of hosting the model locally. Operation requires an API Key (üñäÔ∏èüíµ).
* [Public Release Announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) - StabilityAI's announcement about the public release of Stable Diffusion.
* üñäÔ∏è [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/stablediffusion) - The official Stable Diffusion Discord by StabilityAI.

## Actively Maintained Forks & Containers

All forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release, as they keep the model in memory rather than reloading it after every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may present a risk if used to provide public-facing services, such as Discord bots.

* [basujindal/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion) - "Optimized Stable Diffusion"‚Äîa fork with dramatically reduced VRAM requirements through model splitting, enabling Stable Diffusion on lower-end graphics cards; includes a GradIO web interface and support for weighted prompts.
