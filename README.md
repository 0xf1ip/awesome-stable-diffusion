## Official Resources

* **[CompVis/Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)** - The official release of Stable Diffusion with cli, an AI-based Safety Classifier to (detect and suppresses sexualized content and all the necessary files to get running.
* [stability-AI/stability-sdk](https://github.com/stability-AI/stability-sdk) - The official SDK to build python applications integrating against StabilityAI's cloud platform instead of hosting the model yourself. Operation requires an API Key (üñäÔ∏èüíµ)
* [Public Release Announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) - StabilityAI's public announcement on the release of Stable Diffusion.
* üñäÔ∏è [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/stablediffusion) - The official Stable Diffusion Discord by StabilityAI.

## Actively Maintained Forks & Containers

All forks listed here add additional features and optimisations and are generally faster than the original release as they will keep the model in memory rather than reloading it every prompt. Most forks seem to remove the Safety Classifier which may be a risk in conjunction with third party services such as biscord bots.

* [basujindal/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/basujindal/stable-diffusion) - "Optimized Stable Diffusion", fork with dramatically reduced VRAM requirements through model splitting, enabling stable diffusion on lower end video cards. Includes GradIO web interface, prompt weights

* [replicate/copg-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/replicate/cog-stable-diffusion) - [Cog machine learning container](https://github.com/replicate/cog) of SD v1.4


## Models and Weights

Models (.ckpt files) must be separately downloaded and are required to run Stable Diffusion. The most current model release is v1.4 at this time.

* üñäÔ∏è [Official Model Card](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) - Official Model Card Hugging Face with all versions of the model. Download requires sign in and acceptance of terms of service.
[stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original.chkpt](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original) - The latest model from the model card, required to run Stable Diffusion.
* [RealESRGAN Models](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/) - Download location for the latest RealESRGAN models required to use upscaling by many forks implementing it. Different models exist for realistic and anime content. Please refer to the fork documentation to identify the ones you need.

 
## Online Demos & Collabs

* [HuggingFace/StabilityAI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) - The official demo on HuggingFace Spaces.
* üñäÔ∏èüíµ [Offical Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_diffusion.ipynb) - The official, optimized collab for running SD on Google Cloud. Due to VRAM requirements required Collab Pro to create images.
